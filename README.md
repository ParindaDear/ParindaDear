# 💫Hi, I'm Parinda Lertpituckchaiporn (Dear) :
🎓 I'm currently a 2nd-year IT student at KMUTT   
🚀 Right now, I'm focusing on learning, growing, and becoming a little better every day.  
🐠 I really enjoy spending time with animals and growing plants — those things make me happy.   
💯 Whatever I do, I always give it my all. Not doing things halfway.
